    "Ans:An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.A class is called abstract class only if it has at least one abstract method.\n",
    "when you inherit a abstract class as a parent to the child class,the child class should define all the abstract method present int parent class,if it is not done the child class also becomes abstract class automatically.When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component,we use an abstract class.\n",
