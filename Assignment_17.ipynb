    "1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if guess_me is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal to 7.\n",

If start equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and exit the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.\n",
